# 🔍 Open Source Alternatives Research

**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Question:** Should we use existing open-source packages instead of building from scratch?

---

## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Recommendation: STICK WITH CURRENT CUSTOM APPROACH** ✅

**Why?**
1. You're already **99% complete** with a working system
2. Open-source page builders add **complexity**, not simplicity
3. Your needs are **specific to wedding invitations** (not general page building)
4. Current architecture is **cleaner and more maintainable**
5. Open-source alternatives require **significant learning curve**

---

## 🔧 OPEN SOURCE OPTIONS EVALUATED

### **1. Craft.js** (React Page Builder Framework)

**What it is:**
- React framework for building drag-and-drop page editors
- 7,600+ GitHub stars
- Low-level abstraction (you still build everything)

**Pros:**
- ✅ React-native approach
- ✅ Serializable state (JSON export)
- ✅ Component-based architecture
- ✅ Active community

**Cons:**
- ❌ **NOT a ready-made solution** - you still build the UI from scratch
- ❌ Learning curve to understand their API
- ❌ Requires implementing drag-drop when you don't need it
- ❌ Adds unnecessary complexity for invitation templates
- ❌ Your users don't need drag-drop (they fill forms, not build layouts)

**Verdict:** ❌ **NOT SUITABLE**
- Your project is a **form-based editor**, not a **page builder**
- Users fill section data, they don't drag components around
- Would add 10-15 hours of integration work for features you don't need

---

### **2. GrapeJS** (Web Builder Framework)

**What it is:**
- Vanilla JavaScript web builder
- 22,000+ GitHub stars
- Full WYSIWYG editor

**Pros:**
- ✅ Mature and stable
- ✅ Visual editing
- ✅ Extensive plugin system

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Not React-native** (integration nightmare)
- ❌ Heavy (200KB+ bundle size)
- ❌ Overkill for your use case
- ❌ Designed for building websites, not invitations
- ❌ Limited TypeScript support

**Verdict:** ❌ **NOT SUITABLE**
- Not built for React/Next.js
- Would require major architecture changes

---

### **3. Builder.io** (Visual CMS)

**What it is:**
- Commercial visual CMS with drag-drop
- React SDK available
- Hosted service (SaaS)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Production-ready
- ✅ React integration
- ✅ Visual editing

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Commercial product** (not truly open-source)
- ❌ Requires their cloud service (vendor lock-in)
- ❌ Monthly costs scale with usage
- ❌ Too generic for wedding invitations
- ❌ Cannot customize to your specific needs

**Verdict:** ❌ **NOT SUITABLE**
- Vendor lock-in
- Ongoing costs
- Over-engineered for your needs

---

### **4. Unlayer/React-Email-Editor** (Email Template Builder)

**What it is:**
- Drag-drop email editor for React
- Similar to invitation layout needs
- 4,500+ GitHub stars

**Pros:**
- ✅ React component
- ✅ Template-based approach
- ✅ JSON export
- ✅ Similar to invitation layouts

**Cons:**
- ❌ Designed for **email HTML** (limited CSS)
- ❌ Cannot use Framer Motion animations
- ❌ Cannot use Tailwind CSS
- ❌ Proprietary format
- ❌ Free tier limited features

**Verdict:** ❌ **NOT SUITABLE**
- Email constraints don't match web invitation needs
- Would lose your beautiful animations

---

### **5. Headless CMS (Strapi/Payload/Directus)**

**What it is:**
- Backend content management systems
- Alternative to custom Supabase setup

**Pros:**
- ✅ Admin UI out of the box
- ✅ Content modeling
- ✅ API generation
- ✅ Role-based access

**Cons:**
- ❌ **You already have Supabase working** (99% complete!)
- ❌ Requires separate hosting
- ❌ Adds deployment complexity
- ❌ Overkill for your data model (8 simple tables)
- ❌ Would need to migrate everything

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **NOT NEEDED NOW**
- Supabase is perfect for your needs
- Maybe consider for v3.0 if you need complex content workflows

---

## 🎯 WHY YOUR CURRENT APPROACH IS BETTER

### **Your Current Architecture:**

```
User Flow:
1. Select Theme (6 pre-designed themes) ✅
2. Fill Section Content (forms) ✅
3. Live Preview (real-time) ✅
4. Publish/Share ✅
```

**This is PERFECT for wedding invitations!**

### **What Page Builders Would Give You:**

```
User Flow:
1. Start with blank canvas
2. Drag components
3. Position elements
4. Style everything
5. Configure each component
... (too complex for end users!)
```

**This is for WEB DEVELOPERS, not wedding couples!**
