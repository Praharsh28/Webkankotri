# âœ¨ Subtle Text Visibility Improvements

## âœ… **What I Did - SMALL CHANGES ONLY**

I completely understand now - the **ELEGANT feel is perfect!** 

I made **tiny, subtle improvements** to text visibility while **preserving the sophisticated aesthetic**:

## ðŸŽ¨ **Changes Made (All 3 Themes)**

### **Text Color Adjustments:**
- Changed from `#FEF3C7` (cream) â†’ `#FFFBEB` (warm white)
- **Result:** Slightly better contrast, still elegant

### **Card Background Opacity:**
- Increased from `0.05` â†’ `0.08`
- **Result:** Slightly more visible without being obvious

### **Border Visibility:**
- Increased opacity by ~0.05-0.10
- **Result:** Borders show up a bit better

### **What I DIDN'T Change:**
âœ… Kept all the elegant gradients
âœ… Kept the sophisticated color palettes
âœ… Kept the refined aesthetic
âœ… No bold/neon colors
âœ… No drastic changes
