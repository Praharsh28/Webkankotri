# ü§î Critical Review - Challenge Our Plan

**Before building, let's ask the hard questions.**

---

## ‚ùì Core Questions

### Q1: Are we solving the RIGHT problem?

**Problem stated:** Templates look too basic, not worth ‚Çπ149

**Critical Question:** Is this REALLY why people won't buy, or is it something else?

**Answer:** 
- ‚úÖ YES - Research shows 2025 wedding invitations have video, music, parallax
- ‚úÖ YES - Competitors (Zola, Greenvelope) charge more and have these features
- ‚ùå BUT - We also need to test if people actually WANT these features
- ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK - We might build impressive animations but users want simplicity

**Solution:**
- Build ONE template with ALL features (Royal)
- Get 5-10 real user feedback
- Iterate based on what they actually use/like

---

### Q2: Are we building too much at once?

**Plan:** Animation library ‚Üí Royal template ‚Üí More templates

**Critical Question:** Can we ship something sellable FASTER?

**Answer:**
- ‚ùå NO - Building full animation library first = 2 weeks before seeing results
- ‚úÖ YES - Better to build ONE template end-to-end
- ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK - Building library without real template = might build wrong things

**Better Approach:**
1. Build Royal template (7 days)
   - Create animations AS NEEDED for this template
   - Don't build unused animations
2. Extract reusable animations from Royal (2 days)
3. Build second template faster using extracted animations
4. Repeat

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ See results in 7 days vs 14 days
- ‚úÖ Know animations are actually useful
- ‚úÖ Can test/sell Royal while building others

---

### Q3: Will these animations actually perform on mobile?

**Plan:** Video backgrounds, particles, parallax, fireworks

**Critical Question:** 90% of users are on mobile - will this work?

**Answer:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è HUGE RISK - Video backgrounds are heavy (3-5MB)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è HUGE RISK - Particle systems can drop to 30fps on old phones
- ‚ö†Ô∏è HUGE RISK - Parallax can be janky on mobile browsers

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Detect device capability
- ‚úÖ Provide fallbacks for low-end devices
- ‚úÖ Test on REAL Android phone (not just Chrome DevTools)
- ‚úÖ Budget: 1-2MB max for videos
- ‚úÖ Reduce particle count on mobile (100 ‚Üí 25)
- ‚úÖ Disable parallax on mobile if needed

**Code Example:**
```typescript
const isMobile = /iPhone|iPad|Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent);
const isLowEnd = navigator.hardwareConcurrency < 4;

<FloatingParticles 
  count={isMobile ? 25 : 100}
  disabled={isLowEnd}
/>

<VideoBackground 
  src={isMobile ? '/videos/palace-mobile.mp4' : '/videos/palace-hd.mp4'}
  quality={isMobile ? 'low' : 'high'}
/>
```

---

### Q4: How do we handle users who can't upload videos/music?

**Plan:** Video backgrounds, custom music

**Critical Question:** What if users don't have videos? Is template useless?

**Answer:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PROBLEM - Not everyone has wedding videos ready
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PROBLEM - Music might have copyright issues

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Provide 5-10 stock videos (palace, garden, beach, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Provide 5-10 stock music tracks (royalty-free)
- ‚úÖ Make video/music OPTIONAL
- ‚úÖ Template looks good even without video (gradient background fallback)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
<VideoBackground 
  src={invitation.customVideo || '/videos/default-palace.mp4'}
  fallback={<GradientBackground colors={theme.colors} />}
/>
```

---

### Q5: Are we creating TOO MUCH flexibility?

**Plan:** Users can customize everything

**Critical Question:** Does more flexibility = better UX?

**Answer:**
- ‚ùå NO - Too much flexibility = paradox of choice
- ‚ùå NO - Users want "make it beautiful for me"
- ‚úÖ YES - Power users want customization

**Better Approach:**
- ‚úÖ **Default Mode:** Everything pre-configured, looks great out-of-box
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Mode:** Unlock customization (colors, fonts, animations)
- ‚úÖ Start in Default, let users opt-in to Advanced

**Example:**
```
Default View:
- Just fill: Names, date, venue
- Template looks perfect

Advanced View (Optional):
- Change colors
- Change fonts
- Toggle animations
- Upload custom video
```

---

### Q6: How do we know if animations are "too much"?

**Plan:** Fireworks, particles, parallax, video, music - all at once!

**Critical Question:** Is this elegant or overwhelming?

**Answer:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK - Too many animations = circus, not wedding
- ‚úÖ SOLUTION - Subtle by default, intense on user action

**Design Rules:**
1. **Background Ambiance** - Always on, subtle
   - Video at 30-40% opacity
   - Particles slow and minimal
   - Music at 20-30% volume

2. **User-Triggered** - Only on interaction
   - Fireworks ONLY on RSVP submit
   - Confetti ONLY on specific button
   - Big animations ONLY on scroll

3. **Balance** - One focal point at a time
   - Hero: Video + particles (NOT parallax too)
   - Gallery: Carousel (NOT particles)
   - RSVP: Form (clean, no distractions)

---

### Q7: What if we can't finish Royal template in 7 days?

**Plan:** Build Royal template with all features

**Critical Question:** What's the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?

**Answer - MVP for Royal:**
- ‚úÖ **MUST HAVE:**
  - Video background (or gradient fallback)
  - Countdown timer
  - Photo carousel
  - Working RSVP form
  - Mobile responsive

- ‚è≥ **NICE TO HAVE:**
  - Floating particles
  - Parallax scrolling
  - 3D flip cards
  - Fireworks on RSVP
  - Background music

- ‚ùå **CAN WAIT:**
  - Multiple layout options
  - Advanced customization
  - Analytics dashboard

**Ship MVP First (4 days), then enhance!**

---

### Q8: How do we ensure quality while moving fast?

**Plan:** Build fast, iterate

**Critical Question:** How do we avoid making mistakes?

**Answer:**
- ‚úÖ **Daily Checkpoints:**
  - End of each day: Show working demo
  - User feedback: Does this feel worth ‚Çπ149?
  - Mobile test: Does it work on phone?

- ‚úÖ **Incremental Testing:**
  - Build one animation ‚Üí Test
  - Add to template ‚Üí Test
  - Don't build 10 things then test

- ‚úÖ **User Testing:**
  - Day 4: Show to 3 people
  - Day 7: Show to 5 people
  - Get feedback BEFORE building more

---

### Q9: What about the "vibe coding" problem?

**Problem:** "You do great at start but make mistakes when project gets bigger"

**Critical Question:** How do we prevent this?

**Answer:**
- ‚úÖ **Build in Small Chunks:**
  - ‚ùå DON'T: "Build entire animation library"
  - ‚úÖ DO: "Build VideoBackground component, test, commit"

- ‚úÖ **Review Before Next Step:**
  - After each component, ask: "Is this production-ready?"
  - If not, fix before moving on

- ‚úÖ **User Approval:**
  - Show working demo at checkpoints
  - Get "this looks good" before continuing
  - No surprises at the end

- ‚úÖ **Document Decisions:**
  - Why did we do it this way?
  - What are the tradeoffs?
  - Keep notes in code comments

---

### Q10: Is our template system actually flexible enough?

**Plan:** Block-based system, mix and match

**Critical Question:** Can we actually build 10 different-looking templates with this?

**Answer:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK - If Royal and Traditional look too similar, system failed
- ‚úÖ TEST - Build Royal, then immediately sketch Traditional
- ‚úÖ VERIFY - Do they look DISTINCTLY different?

**Each template should have:**
- Unique color palette
- Unique animations
- Unique layout style
- Unique personality

**If they just differ by colors = FAILED**

---

## üí° Key Insights from Critical Review

1. **Build template FIRST, extract library SECOND**
   - Don't build unused animations
   - Real template shows what's actually needed

2. **MVP in 4 days, enhance for 3 days**
   - Ship something sellable fast
   - Polish based on feedback

3. **Mobile performance is CRITICAL**
   - Test on real Android phone
   - Fallbacks for everything

4. **User testing every 3-4 days**
   - Catch problems early
   - Build what users actually want

5. **Each template must look UNIQUE**
   - Not just color variations

## üé¨ What We Build First

**Start with Royal Template:**
1. Day 1: VideoBackground + Template structure
2. Day 2: Countdown + Carousel
3. Day 3: RSVP form + Mobile polish
4. Day 4: User testing checkpoint
5. Days 5-7: Enhance based on feedback

**Key Question After Day 4:** "Would someone pay ‚Çπ149 for this?"
- If YES ‚Üí Continue enhancing
- If NO ‚Üí Stop and fix before building more

---

## ü§ù Agreement

**Before we start coding, agree on:**

1. ‚úÖ We build Royal template first (not animation library)
2. ‚úÖ We test on mobile after each component
3. ‚úÖ We show working demo on Day 4 for feedback
4. ‚úÖ We DON'T continue if Day 4 demo isn't worth ‚Çπ149
5. ‚úÖ We build small chunks, test, commit (no big surprises)

**Do you agree with this approach?**

If yes, let's start with Day 1: VideoBackground component!
If no, what would you change?
