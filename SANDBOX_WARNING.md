# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: SANDBOX IS NOT ISOLATED YET!

## 🚨 **CRITICAL WARNING**

### **Current Situation:**

**URL:** http://localhost:3000/sandbox

**⚠️ WARNING: Changes WILL affect your production code!**

### **Why?**

All sandbox tools currently use the **REAL components** from:
- `components/sections/*.tsx`
- `components/invite/SectionRenderer.tsx`
- `lib/themes/*.ts`

**If you edit a component file, it changes EVERYWHERE:**
- ✅ In the sandbox
- ✅ In the create wizard
- ✅ In the edit page
- ✅ In published invitations
- ✅ **EVERYWHERE!**

---

## 🎯 **What You Have Now**

### **Sandbox Page** (http://localhost:3000/sandbox)

**Features:**
- ✅ View ALL sections at once (like create wizard Step 2)
- ✅ Toggle sections on/off
- ✅ Switch between 6 themes
- ✅ Card mode or Full page mode
- ✅ See all 19 sections in one scrollable view

**BUT:**
- ❌ NOT isolated from production
- ❌ Changes affect real code
- ❌ Can break things

---

## 💡 **What You Need**

### **True Isolated Sandbox**

To create a REAL sandbox that won't affect production, we need to:

1. **Copy all components** to `components/sandbox/`
2. **Copy all themes** to `lib/sandbox-themes/`
3. **Use copied versions** in sandbox
4. **Keep production components** separate

**This way:**
- Sandbox = Experiment freely ✅
- Production = Always safe ✅

---

## 🛠️ **How to Create True Sandbox**

### **Option 1: Manual (Safer)**
```bash
# Copy components
cp -r components/sections components/sandbox-sections
cp -r lib/themes lib/sandbox-themes

# Then update sandbox page to use:
import * as Sections from '@/components/sandbox-sections'
import { getTheme } from '@/lib/sandbox-themes'
```

### **Option 2: Automated (Riskier)**
I can create a script to:
1. Duplicate all components
2. Rename imports
3. Create isolated sandbox

**But this adds complexity!**

---

## 🎯 **Current Best Practice**

### **For Now:**

1. **Use Git Branching**
   ```bash
   # Create experiment branch
   git checkout -b experiment-animations
   
   # Make changes in sandbox
   # Test thoroughly
   
   # If good:
   git checkout main
   git merge experiment-animations
   
   # If bad:
   git checkout main
   # Experiment branch stays separate
   ```

2. **Use Version Control**
   - Always commit before experimenting
   - Can easily revert if needed
   - See exactly what changed

3. **Test in Sandbox First**
   - Make changes
   - View in sandbox (all sections visible)
   - If looks good, keep it
   - If bad, git revert

---

## 📋 **What Each Tool Does**

### **1. Animation Lab** (http://localhost:3000/animation-lab)
- Shows ONE section at a time
- Uses REAL components
- Good for: Focusing on one section
- ⚠️ Changes affect production

### **2. Sandbox** (http://localhost:3000/sandbox)
- Shows ALL sections at once
- Uses REAL components
- Good for: Seeing full invitation flow
- ⚠️ Changes affect production

### **3. Template Playground** (http://localhost:3000/template-playground)
- Complex, has issues
- Not recommended
- Use Sandbox instead

### **4. Create Wizard** (/create)
- Real production flow
- Uses database
- For actual invitation creation

---

## 🎨 **Recommended Workflow**

### **Safe Experimentation:**

```
1. Commit your work first
   git add .
   git commit -m "Before animation experiments"

2. Open sandbox
   http://localhost:3000/sandbox

3. Enable all sections you want to test

4. Edit component file
   Example: components/sections/HeaderSection.tsx

5. See changes in sandbox immediately

6. If good: Keep it! Already in production code
   If bad: git reset --hard (reverts changes)
```

---

## ❓ **Should I Create True Isolated Sandbox?**

### **Pros:**
- ✅ Can't break production
- ✅ Experiment freely
- ✅ Compare side-by-side

### **Cons:**
- ❌ Doubles codebase size
- ❌ Maintenance overhead
- ❌ Changes need manual copying to production
- ❌ More complex

### **Recommendation:**

**Use Git + Current Sandbox:**
- Simpler
- Faster
- Easy to revert
- Changes immediately in production when ready

**Create True Sandbox Only If:**
- You experiment A LOT
- Need to test risky changes
- Want multiple versions side-by-side

## 🚀 **Current Sandbox Features**

### **Visit:** http://localhost:3000/sandbox

**You Get:**
1. ✅ All 19 sections visible at once
2. ✅ Scrollable view (just like create wizard)
3. ✅ Toggle any section on/off
4. ✅ Switch between 6 themes
5. ✅ Card mode (white card) or Full mode (full page)
6. ✅ Section labels showing which is which
7. ✅ Real-time updates
8. ✅ Stats showing active sections

**This is what you asked for!** 🎉

## 💭 **Do You Want Me To:**

### **Option A: Keep Current Setup** (Recommended)
- Use Git for safety
- Sandbox shows all sections
- Simple & fast
- Changes go to production when ready

### **Option B: Create True Isolated Sandbox**
- Copy all components
- Separate sandbox folder
- Can't break production
- More complex, more maintenance

**What do you prefer?** 🤔

---

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Sandbox created (all sections visible)
- ✅ Works perfectly
- ⚠️ Not isolated (uses real components)
- ⚠️ Changes affect production

**Files Created (Not committed):**
- `app/sandbox/page.tsx` - Full sandbox page
- `SANDBOX_WARNING.md` - This file

**Ready to use, just be aware of the warning!** ⚠️
