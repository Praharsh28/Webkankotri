## What Was Removed

All the "improvement" commits:
- ~~961c7c9~~ Rollback note (removed)
- ~~eedcf3a~~ SVG handling (removed - was causing issues)
- ~~4ea19b7~~ Third scan (removed)
- ~~f8313d3~~ Second scan (removed)

## Why This Version Works

**Simple is better!**

This version:
- ‚úÖ Fewer lines of code
- ‚úÖ No complex SVG element checks
- ‚úÖ Straightforward overlay creation
- ‚úÖ No edge case handling that broke core functionality

The later commits tried to "fix" edge cases but broke the main feature.

## Important Note

**DO NOT try to "fix" or "improve" the editor unless:**
1. You test it in browser FIRST
2. The blue selection box still works
3. All features are tested
4. Changes are minimal (1-2 lines max)

**The editor works now. Leave it alone!** üôè
