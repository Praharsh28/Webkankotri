# ⚡ Quick Decision Summary

## Your Question
> "Should we use open-source packages instead of building from scratch?"

## Answer
**NO - Keep your custom approach!** ✅

---

## 3-Minute Summary

### What I Researched
1. **Craft.js** - React page builder framework
2. **GrapeJS** - Web builder framework
3. **Builder.io** - Commercial visual CMS
4. **Unlayer** - Email template builder
5. **Headless CMS** - Strapi, Payload, Directus

### The Problem
All of these are **page builders** for creating websites.

Your project is **NOT a page builder** - it's a **template customization tool**.

### The Difference

**Page Builder (what they do):**
- User drags components around
- User positions elements
- User styles everything
- Takes 30-60 minutes
- Complex interface
- Made for web designers

**Your Product (what you built):**
- User picks a theme
- User fills form data
- System applies styling
- Takes 5-10 minutes
- Simple interface
- Made for regular people
